# Evolutionary Algorithm for Optimization

This project showcases an implementation of an evolutionary algorithm designed for optimization tasks. The algorithm is implemented in Python and utilizes a population of "bots" to evolve and improve their performance in a predefined fitness landscape.

## Key Features

- **Population Initialization:** The project starts by creating a population of bots. Each bot is represented by a set of five parameters (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`), each initialized with random values.

- **Fitness Function:** The fitness of each bot is determined by a custom fitness function called `auswertung()`. This function evaluates the performance of a bot based on its parameters and assigns a fitness score.

- **Selection:** In each generation, the algorithm selects the top-performing bots from the population to form the next generation. The selection process retains the best-performing bots, ensuring that they are carried forward to the next generation.

- **Crossover:** The algorithm employs a unique crossover method called `swap()` to create new bots. It swaps random parameter values between two bots, producing offspring with a combination of their parent's traits.

- **Evolutionary Process:** The evolutionary process spans multiple generations, with each generation aiming to improve the population's fitness. The algorithm continues to select, crossover, and evolve bots, iteratively optimizing their parameter values.

- **Monitoring and Reporting:** The project provides detailed debugging information when the `DEBUG` flag is set to `True`. It tracks the best bots, their fitness scores, and the generation they belong to, providing insights into the algorithm's progress.

## Usage

The project can be used to optimize a specific objective function by modifying the `auswertung()` function according to the optimization problem.

Parameters like the population size (`num_bots`), number of generations (`generations`), and mutation rate can be adjusted to fine-tune the algorithm for different optimization tasks.

## Outcome

The algorithm continually evolves and selects the best-performing bots, aiming to find the optimal parameter values for the given fitness landscape.

This project serves as a demonstration of an evolutionary algorithm's implementation and can be adapted for various optimization tasks by defining an appropriate fitness function.
